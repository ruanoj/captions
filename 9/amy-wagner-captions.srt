00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,272
NARRATOR: Welcome to Peer to Peer,

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:05,920
where you can watch how
experts solve tech problems.

3
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:11,376
Our guest today is Amy Wagner,
who is an independent Agile coach and consultant.

4
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:14,656
And a co-author of the Minimum Viable book.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,128
Amy's client today is Anna Bowers,
who's a product manager at Dorling Kindersley,

6
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:22,448
an international publishers.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,760
Anna is managing the
development of a new digital product,

8
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:29,968
which has lots of different
stakeholders and a new development team.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
Her company is used to sharing
physical products on a fixed timetable.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,080
For this new digital product, they're
interested in adopting a more agile methodology

11
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:42,640
and they're keen to get some coaching from Amy.

12
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:47,632
In this Peer to Peer session, we'll
see how Amy coaches a client on a new project.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,608
She'll work through 3 Agile techniques
that she felt were appropriate in this case:

14
00:00:52,672 --> 00:00:57,600
the 'Spine', 'Inception', and 'Impact Mapping'.

15
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:01,552
[Chapter 1]

16
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:05,088
AMY WAGNER: So Anna maybe you
can tell us a little bit about your product.

17
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:09,856
ANNA BOWERS: Yes, so I work
for a publisher based in the UK.

18
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:13,568
And I sit on the web team as a product manager.

19
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:18,832
And we're just about to
kick off an exciting new product.

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:25,904
And we've done about 3 or 4 months of
discovery work, and we're looking to get into sprint.

21
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:30,672
It's going to be an online learning tool.

22
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,456
It started with a print element and we're
going to take some of that and put it online,

23
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,688
so there's a digital element:
and that's the bit I'm working on.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,480
It consists of a course book
and some practice books.

25
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:46,704
We need to host audio files
that go with the course book online

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,648
And we also need to put
some practice exercises online.

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,448
And potentially monetize
them and create user accounts.

28
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,984
And track progress of the users.

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:08,672
AW: If you were to describe your
product in one sentence... How would you do that?

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,088
AB: Alright, let me have a go.

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:19,968
So it's an online self study tool for adult learners...

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,544
that let's them track their progress.

33
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:26,460
[New Chapter]

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,712
AW: Right, so Anna, let's
do an exercise called 'The Spine'.

35
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:39,808
The spine is something that you should
be doing with your team and your stakeholders

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,968
So we're going to run through it together now...

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
AB: So that I can take it away.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,184
AW: Yes, exactly, so we can practice
the technique and you can take it away.

39
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:55,952
So we will to start with two minutes of individual
ideas that come to you about the product.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:05,680
So one idea per poster note, and single
words or very short sentences if you can,

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,960
to describe the product... The kind
of tone... Maybe to describe what it's doing,

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,456
what problems it might be solving for the user.

43
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,960
I don't want to give you any more guidance than
that because I want to see what you come up with.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,000
So let's do that now. I'll hand you this.

45
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:24,780
AB: Sticky notes.

46
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:33,488
AW: Yes. OK so as many ideas as you
can muster, one per 'post it' note... Two minutes.

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,264
Let's go. AB: OK.

48
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:43,904
AB: Alright, so the fist one is
that it's an online learning tool.

49
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,448
That's what it is in the basic sense.

50
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,544
It gives a sense of progression for anyone using it.

51
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,136
It's got a professional tone

52
00:03:53,130 --> 00:04:01,984
It's got a visual tone as well, because
the company is aesthetic, it's very visual.

53
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,112
So there are a lot of bright images,
and things like that, to help with online learning.

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:16,224
And it's self-led as well, so it's instructional
but it's for people to use without a teacher.

55
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,576
AW: Nice... I like it.

56
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:26,624
Good, so at this point, if we were doing this
exercise with your stakeholders and your team,

57
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:32,656
We would go round one by one to everyone
in the room (ideally not more than about 10 people),

58
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:36,380
and get everyone to put
their post it notes up as well,

59
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:43,808
and explain to the group the reasons for
why they did it, exactly like you just did it then.

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,832
And once everyone has gone
round and explained their 'post it' notes

61
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,008
So what we do then is cluster.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,152
AB: Yes, and hopefully
there will be lots of similar ideas.

63
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,088
AW: Yes, that's the idea... You reach
a kind of alignment through clustering.

64
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:11,872
Someone might say self-led and someone else
might say something like self leading [laughter].

65
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,040
Are there any here that you think
look similar? No they all look different.

66
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,144
They're their own things...

67
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:27,472
Right, so let's say we've got
some others that are clustered here.

68
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,432
I've put my ideas down [inaudible]

69
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:42,960
Typically you get a bigger cluster on a
certain few of them, and others become outliers.

70
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,272
And they are the ones that only a couple
of people, or only one person has thought about.

71
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:56,608
And then it's quite easy to
see where popular opinion lies.

72
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,816
Typically at that point we
also do a little bit of dot voting.

73
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:06,810
I'm going to give you some stickers.
My favorites at the moment are stars: you can use any.

74
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,672
If you don't have any stickers...
AB: Buy some! AW: Yes. [laughter].

75
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:20,016
Or you can give everyone a different
color pen, and get them to vote on something

76
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:23,136
by just putting a little dot on these.

77
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:31,232
What I would normally do is give people...
Definitely less votes per number of clusters.

78
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:34,352
That forces you to prioritize.

79
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,240
In fact, you can see that
I'm giving you three stars there.

80
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:45,296
And the other thing that I ask
people to do is to use their stickers

81
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:54,352
to indicate what they think is the most important,
and so you can vote on something twice in that case.

82
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,320
[They both talk at once]

83
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:02,912
You can put an even spread,
whatever makes sense to you.

84
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,984
So go ahead and vote and maybe
you can talk us through while your doing it.

85
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,648
AB: That's really what the product is.

86
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,720
If you didn't have any of those
that would still be the product.

87
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I might even put another one on there.

88
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:20,656
AW: Oh no you'll have to take some of the others off!

89
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:26,608
AB: It's quite difficult...
I'm going to go self led as well.

90
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,544
I would put one on visual if I could too.

91
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,048
But you've only got three.

92
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,192
So are you happy with that? AB: Yes, I am.

93
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,792
AW: That really does help you to
weed it out doesn't it? AB: It does.

94
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,672
AW: So this one is the winner, it got 2 votes.

95
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,352
This has got 1 vote.

96
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,760
And these are outliers.

97
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:57,104
If it was a whole group of people, and these got
no votes I'd put them completely out of the picture.

98
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,312
I would say "OK, let's not
think about that for the moment".

99
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,216
But because it's us, and you've got a bit of an
overview, and we're just doing this as an example,

100
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,832
we'll bring these back in.

101
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:18,016
The next bit is sometimes the most difficult bit,
but where you get the real output from the exercise.

102
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,016
And that's where we construct
the single sentence description,

103
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:25,264
or the 'Spine', of what we're talking about.

104
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:35,824
Using these key words, let's see if they match
back to what you said earlier about the product.

105
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,168
Normally I start out like
this if I'm facilitating a session.

106
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,528
I would say... Like a basic starting point.

107
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,208
If we take some of these and
try to construct this sentence.

108
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,992
It doesn't matter if you don't use all of these,
but it would be nice to leave them in somewhere,

109
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,976
because, let's imagine if we've
got all the stakeholders in the room,

110
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:08,480
We've just got this top 5 list of words, and we want
to try and add them to the sentence at this point.

111
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,488
We want them to form part of the final product.

112
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,680
So let me just start you off.

113
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:26,970
We are building an online learning tool.

114
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:41,936
It is self led and professional.

115
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:48,560
AB: And is visual... For progression.

116
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,080
AW: For progression of?
I'll let you finish the rest of that.

117
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,504
AB: Well yes, this is for the user needs.

118
00:09:57,216 --> 00:10:07,664
So it is progression for
personal or professional lives.

119
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,320
AW: We can put that down here then and move that there.

120
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:21,936
Its probably good to remember, that it might be
easy for you to do in isolation, but with a few people...

121
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:28,944
AB: Yes, but if you have a controversial one that not
everyone agrees with, how would you deal with that?

122
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,912
AW: I think it's important to let
people communicate why they want that.

123
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:38,272
There is also a kind of secret
goal of doing a session like this,

124
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:45,792
We're trying to align everyone in the
room, and get anything controversial out of the way.

125
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:56,608
And I think a single sentence is one artifact
that comes out of quite a lot of communication.

126
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,808
And a lot of alignment that
happens in the room on the day.

127
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,416
This just reminds you that everyone is on the
same page, if you come back to this again and again.

128
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,648
So that's the 'Spine'... Do you remember
what you described at the start of the session?

129
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,320
No it would be really interesting to... Learning tool.

130
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:24,880
I guess it doesn't really matter because
what I want you to do is take this away

131
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:33,720
and get those people in a room that have strong
opinions about what this product should be.

132
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:41,640
Maybe they're the ones that need to
hit the revenue target within the organization.

133
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,208
Get them to input using an exercise like this.

134
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:49,648
See if that comes back to where you are.

135
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,600
AB: I know, I'm going to take a photo of this
and see how close we can get to it next week.

136
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,400
AW: And if it's completely
different, maybe that's OK too.

137
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,512
Good, so that's the 'Spine'.

138
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,800
[New Chapter]

139
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,920
AW: So here's one for you that you might
want to run when you've got the team together,

140
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,136
and what now?, and you want
to brief them about what's going on.

141
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:24,208
You want to get any concerns about how
this might be running out in the open at the start.

142
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,344
AB: Sounds good.

143
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:34,432
AW: So normally the focus for this...
And this is called 'The Inception' by the way.

144
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:42,560
You often find that people in GS use this,
and Jamie Arnold, runs these things with his team.

145
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,656
Lots of people will run an 'Inception'
when you're about to kick off a product.

146
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,536
AB: I think I really need to do that in my kick off.

147
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,800
AW: It's a nice way to get
everyone together and work through it.

148
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,216
So an 'Inception' normally
has these other lists to it.

149
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:07,920
Before we finish we're going to see if we can
come up with some mitigation for these fears too.

150
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,944
So again it's a post up exercise, everyone has post it notes.

151
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:21,900
And the first thing that you get everyone to
think about is "What's driving us to do this product?"

152
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:28,752
"What's driving the organization to do
this product and what do we need from it?"

153
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,512
So I think we should do
a couple of ideas, just talking,

154
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,208
rather than you going off
and thinking about it at this time.

155
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,288
So anything that comes to mind
about why we're building this online learning tool?

156
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,240
AB: There is potential, market potential.

157
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:54,736
AW: So is that revenue, or just getting
the users from one or the other or both?

158
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,440
AB: I think immediately there's a market
share potential and then a revenue potential.

159
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:12,912
Yes, there's a lot of research
that says online learning is growing.

160
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,840
AW: Yes! So there's a clear opportunity there.

161
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,520
So market share, revenue, clear opportunity.

162
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:33,184
At this point we would ask everyone in the team to
put theirs up on the wall too and talk them through.

163
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,592
AB: Yes, there's a lot of research that
goes into those two before hand, in 'discoverys',

164
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:41,184
so there would probably be a
lot of discussion around the drivers.

165
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,352
AW: So if you have already done your 'Spine',

166
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,976
this is normally where you present the it,
or some of the work that's been done previously,

167
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,760
so everyone would
understand these on the wall here.

168
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:05,264
And I think also, if you get a lot of
drivers on the wall, not just these few main ones,

169
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,560
a little bit of dot voting as well, like
we did in the 'Inception' so getting everyone to...

170
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,552
AB: What is a good number of drivers then?

171
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,392
AW: I wouldn't put a rule on something like this...

172
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,904
AB: But you can have loads, yes?

173
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,392
AW: If you have loads, it's nice to know
if one is more important than the others.

174
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,928
AB: So you can have loads,
but you need to prioritize them.

175
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,432
AW: Exactly.

176
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,168
Because there's a difference
here [they both talk at once]

177
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,936
AB: They may become different... In time

178
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,680
AB: Yes, so one of them is more
important now, one is more important in the future.

179
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,064
AW: So if you were to prioritize
these two now, would it be this way?

180
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,448
AB: Yes.

181
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,624
AW: So this is number 1.

182
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,688
And this is number 2.

183
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,136
AB: I don't know what my
manager will say about that. [laughter]

184
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,400
I think that's right.

185
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:01,328
AW: A lot of products go for users first,
and then try and monetize later.

186
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,928
And try and get the revenue. I can't
believe I just said that word "monetize".

187
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,912
AB: Yes, you said it, we heard it.

188
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:08,890
AW: I need to put a pound in the jar.

189
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:14,448
Anyway, so  that's how you would prioritize it.

190
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,136
There you go, you've been quite
linear with your drivers... Accidentally

191
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:23,408
AB: On purpose.
AW: Accidentally, on purpose! [laughter]

192
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,512
OK, so let's say the whole
team have done their drivers,

193
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,512
and everyone's had a discussion about that.

194
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,576
And do you know what
happens accidentally during this process?

195
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:40,704
Accidentally, you have also communicated
to everybody that this is more important than that.

196
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,568
And everyone's on exactly the same page.

197
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,408
You can have an artifact later
to say [they both talk at once].

198
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,672
Remember when you said market
share was more important than revenue?

199
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,376
Well that is the case for the first
6 months, or whatever context was there.

200
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:04,800
OK, how about hopes. What are your hopes
for the product... And this can be personal, as well.

201
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,408
This can be, like... Success based metrics.

202
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:24,576
OK, so you want a well received
product. What does that mean, awards or...

203
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:29,472
AB: I think you could spin off awards from that.

204
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:34,912
I would like user testing to
come back with lots of positives.

205
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:42,368
For it to make changes to peoples
lives, so they achieve their goals.

206
00:17:42,448 --> 00:17:46,128
Those things are quite hard to measure I suppose.

207
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,200
I want it to be well designed and well
thought through, those are the hopes.

208
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,296
And how do you measure well designed,
what's your perception of 'well designed'?

209
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:02,224
AB: Well it goes back to one of the
principles, but I can't remember which one.

210
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:09,584
AW: Oh it would be continuous attention
to technical and design excellence?

211
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,464
So Design excellence.

212
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,744
AB: Yes, just keeping an eye on things
like technical debt and making sure...

213
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,192
AW: So design in terms of
technical aspect as well, right, good.

214
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:29,200
AW: And the way the team works together
as well, would you want that to be one of them?

215
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,664
From your career... It's OK to
say these things and then 'Inception'...

216
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,280
AB: Yes, I want a happy team.

217
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,832
I want a happy team that has continuous learning.

218
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,830
AW: Nice.

219
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,664
AB: Yes, so these are some goals.

220
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,216
AW: OK great, I think that's good for now.

221
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,280
And again what we normally do in
'Inception' when the whole team are here...

222
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,400
you would go round the room...
And so you would have lots of...

223
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,888
You would end up seeing clusters of similar as well.

224
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,168
And then you can ask anyone who is
coming along to then go, OK well that's similar

225
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:17,600
to what Anna said, so we'll put
that together and that becomes a cluster

226
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:25,408
which is about design excellence
or well designed options - that kind of thing.

227
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,752
And again it would be nice to
dot vote as well. [they both talk at once]

228
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,120
It might be that this is more important than this

229
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,176
because usually these things make
these things happen with a happy team.

230
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:47,472
That's the most important,
it goes well beyond most things.

231
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:55,312
So then you would end up with your order of priority.

232
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:59,248
So let's say we've dot voted
and this has come out number 1,

233
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,904
this has come out number 2,

234
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,680
and this is number 3.

235
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:10,384
Circulate that, put it on the wall in
your teams area, anything that that your fearful of

236
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:15,180
kicking this product off.

237
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:21,424
AB: OK if it fails, I mean there's lots
of different ways of describing failure

238
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:30,016
but 'fails' is badly received I
think - I've got well received there

239
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:34,608
Badly received. AW: Yes.

240
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:41,840
Here's a thing, just a quick tangent; it would be nice
to know this sooner rather that later wouldn't it?

241
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,536
AB: Like at the beginning. AW: Yes.

242
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,272
So the sooner you can test this the better; the approach you're going for.

243
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,632
AB: Yes, with early testing.

244
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:59,184
Other fears - that it breaks.

245
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:08,208
AW: So when you say break, do you
mean things like data loss, poor user experience...

246
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,120
that sort of thing?

247
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,072
AB: I mean that sort of thing.

248
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,152
AW: You can have poor user experience
with that as well but still, I guess that's an idea.

249
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,600
AB: We could go massively over budget.

250
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,032
We could run out of time.

251
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,248
We could miss our market opportunity.

252
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,016
There are lots of things, but there's a few.

253
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,336
AW: So do you have a specific time frame in mind?

254
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,840
AB: Yes

255
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,600
AW: So what are you thinking about.

256
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,032
AB: We're aiming for June 2016.

257
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:55,920
AW: So just under a year.

258
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,240
And what about a budget,
do you have a specific budget.

259
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,976
AB: We do yes, and we can't go over that.

260
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,808
AW: So that's like - this is the maximum possible.

261
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:20,800
And so if you get half way and you burned through
that entire budget that's not going to be good.

262
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,808
AB: But like you were saying, if you
can measure all of these as early as possible

263
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,480
then you can mitigate them. AW: Exactly.

264
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:38,496
So that's the next thing - to look at
all the fears individually and to mitigate them.

265
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,336
And we'll just rush through this
really quickly because this is the stuff

266
00:22:42,352 --> 00:22:47,104
you really should be doing with the
team once you understand the technique.

267
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,328
Is there anything you can do to sort of control this?

268
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,792
AB: Yes, user testing would help a lot.

269
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:03,296
AW: And release as early as possible so
you know you're going down the right path.

270
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:09,728
So early releases, and that
term, minimal viable product.

271
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,896
I've heard that one before,
maybe from that book "The Lean Startup".

272
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:19,664
That helps you narrow in on
something early, that you can test early,

273
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,560
and get it out the door, and see
if it's worth taking that approach,

274
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,512
before you invest too much time into
it, whatever that approach might be.

275
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:35,408
Let's think about what we
can do to mitigate it 'breaking'.

276
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,096
AB: Yes, data loss and things like that...
Testing.

277
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:47,456
User acceptance testing, regression
testing... All the testing.

278
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:52,960
With a list of best practices
so we can have a standard.

279
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
Early on as well, hopefully.

280
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,464
And I found that it's good to get as
many people as possible working on the project

281
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:07,260
doing all of these things, rather
than just one person doing it all.

282
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,328
AW: And other things that software
development teams are doing a lot of lately

283
00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:17,536
is test driven development...
So writing tests before features.

284
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:23,792
And also developers are owning their tests, not
just passing it on to the person who owns testing.

285
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,240
And launching it over the fence to
someone else who can think about testing.

286
00:24:28,304 --> 00:24:34,030
AB: Yes, I'm not a massive fan
of everyone having a go at that.

287
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,064
AW: Budgets.

288
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:46,624
AB: Yes, erm... We've done a few similar
projects, so I think we've got a good budget estimate

289
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:54,080
That is a fear, but I think we've mitigated
it already by using other products as a template.

290
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:59,888
So you've seen how some of the
other products...[they both talk at once]

291
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,712
AB: So using past learning.

292
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,584
AW: Past learning, that's a great
one, and was that with the same team?

293
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,224
AB: Yes.

294
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:15,216
AW: Well that's great because that's a bit of an
unknown if you're setting up with a new product team.

295
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:21,184
But since your using an established
product team within your organization...

296
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:28,352
AB: And with that one as well, we
do quite a lot of comparative testing.

297
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:32,464
if we want to use a new bit of
software, or if we want a new component,

298
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:38,512
we look at different ways of achieving
that and balance benefit against cost.

299
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,232
AW: Cost benefit analysis.

300
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,504
AB: Definitely. So yes, that's
how we would mitigate that.

301
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,576
AW: Running out of time.

302
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,800
AB: We just cant run out of time, that's it!

303
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:59,200
This comes back to one of the
big fears I have about this project,

304
00:25:59,248 --> 00:26:03,248
which is over-promising on spring deliveries.

305
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:10,704
So managing the expectations
and the work capacity of a sprint

306
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:17,632
will be integral in not running out of time and
working out how much we can realistically deliver.

307
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,328
And not taking on too much.

308
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,736
AW: Sorry to put words in
your mouth, is that what you meant?

309
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:31,152
AB: Yes, totally, we need to
balance expectations against effort.

310
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:37,264
AW: The other thing that might help
you with this one is early releases again.

311
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,120
AB: Having an MVP and then building on that.

312
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,392
AW: If you have a finite deadline, and that's
another myth of agile products and agile teams

313
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,880
is that there aren't any deadlines,
and no planning and no discipline.

314
00:26:49,168 --> 00:26:56,440
Well I absolutely challenge that because
I think there's much more frequent deadlines.

315
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,472
There's loads and loads of little deadlines.

316
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:04,432
AB: Yes, which people respond to quite well
I think, rather than that massive one at the end.

317
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:11,136
AW: And we allow the solution in
the scope to be a bit more flexible.

318
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,744
And get there as simply and quickly as we can.

319
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:22,496
So if you were releasing very simple
versions of your product very regularly,

320
00:27:22,656 --> 00:27:28,464
you might know ahead of time
whether you are taking too much on.

321
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,384
AB: Perfect.

322
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:37,248
AW: So early releases is another one for that.

323
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:44,592
Right, OK so that is an 'Inception',
normally done with a full team and stakeholders.

324
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:50,944
A chance for everyone to get
their hopes and fears out into the open.

325
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:57,008
And you really should encourage everyone
to be as honest as possible in that meeting.

326
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,720
[New Chapter]

327
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:05,392
AW: OK Anna, now we're going
to do some impact mapping.

328
00:28:05,488 --> 00:28:08,608
And here's one I prepared earlier.

329
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:18,272
Impact mapping is a technique that helps
you work out why you're doing something,

330
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,736
the users, or who you are doing it for,

331
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,152
how you do it... The impact you have on those users,

332
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,160
and a few ideas and experiments
on how you can make that happen.

333
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,976
So it looks a little bit like
this when one's finished.

334
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,736
So you would have a big WHY here which is your goal.

335
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:47,872
And the next level out you would have
a few WHOs, also called the 'actors' in this technique.

336
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,416
So they're your users.

337
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:55,856
You know your audiences, so at that point we ask:

338
00:28:55,872 --> 00:29:02,672
what impact do we want to have
on their behaviour, to get back to the WHY.

339
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:10,016
As an example, if you were going for
a number of users to use your service

340
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:18,000
We would say maybe, young professionals in
their 20s could be this segment.

341
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:24,224
And what we want to happen
to them would be the next level.

342
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,768
So how do we want their behaviour to change.

343
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:39,920
And then the next level after that is
WHAT, so ideas for features, ideas for deliverables,

344
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,264
And it ends up a little bit like a line map, like this.

345
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,448
So you might have a couple here, and one there,

346
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,008
And that's a how and that
goes off into lots of directions.

347
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,816
You end up with something like
that after we've finished the workshop.

348
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:03,520
Again this is something you should
do with your team and your stakeholders.

349
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,888
This is usually the trickiest part... We need a goal.

350
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:13,488
AB: Yes... It is 10,000 users.

351
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:19,184
AW: Great, she knows what she wants... 10,000 users.

352
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,768
So with our online learning
tool we want to reach 10,000 users.

353
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,304
How can we get there... Well we'll find out.

354
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,216
Who would you say would be your actors, or your users?

355
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:40,784
At this point it's useful to group
them, rather than thinking of every segment.

356
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,440
AB: Well the tool is for adult
learners, so they've all got to be adults.

357
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,192
They probably have
different motivations for learning.

358
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:59,616
And it's all adult second language learners.

359
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,392
AW: It's all second language learning?

360
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:06,688
AB: Yes, English as a second language.

361
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:11,520
AW: It might be something you
could divide into different language groups.

362
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,832
AB: Yes, and I think a massive
part of it is the Spanish market.

363
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:25,040
So we would have adult English
language learners, in the Spanish one.

364
00:31:25,072 --> 00:31:29,130
AW: Let's use that one as an example.

365
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,960
That's an example.

366
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:37,504
One of the tricky things... As a
technique you can see it's fairly standard,

367
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,880
It feels like just a line map, it
feels pretty easy from the outside,

368
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:48,880
but then you have to be more specific,
break it down and use the right grouping,

369
00:31:48,944 --> 00:31:51,280
It can be a little bit trial and error.

370
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,888
OK so that would be one group.

371
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,600
And with your team it would be interesting
to break that down into further groups.

372
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,680
And whether you wanted to carry
on putting it into different language groups,

373
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,912
or other types of segments... Like to do
with age... That might be another one as well.

374
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,904
AB: So can these be derived from your personas?

375
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,752
AW: Yes, so ideally you'll
be working with a user researcher. 

376
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:21,856
You said you had done some
discovery work already on this product.

377
00:32:21,888 --> 00:32:24,416
AB: Yes, we've got some personas in mind.

378
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:26,480
AB: So would that  be where you would put these guys?

379
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,480
AW: Yeah! If you feel like they're the
personas that you feel comfortable with

380
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,208
then yes, you can break it down into that.

381
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:44,830
The only thing to remember is that a lot
of the time personas are built as assumptions.

382
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,536
Rather than who your users really are.

383
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,920
So it might be that they are
your personas to start off with.

384
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,768
But after you've got to one
hundred, two hundred, or even ten users.

385
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,904
Those personas might not be the personas
that you thought you were going to have.

386
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:09,920
So that's a kind of caveat, maybe
it's a living map as you develop.

387
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,008
So we've got one user group then.

388
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,368
The next part is the impact, and in
my mind this is one of the trickiest,

389
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,776
but the most useful parts of the impact map.

390
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:31,952
So this is about trying to work
out how we want to change these user groups.

391
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,776
The behaviour of these actors

392
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,632
So how can we change their behaviour to get to there?

393
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:43,040
And these are also people who
can support or appraise you as well.

394
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,496
AB: OK, give me an example of what you mean by that.

395
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:53,408
AW: So... Let's see... You want them to sign up.

396
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:58,512
Let's just make that clear here... You want them to sign up.

397
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:04,384
So you might want to
provide say... An incentive for them.

398
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,600
AB: And would that be the WHAT,
so the incentive is how is their sign-up.

399
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:20,432
AW: Yes, that's a good question. So if
we say the incentive... Let's say that is an incentive.

400
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:24,112
The way you give the incentive is the WHAT.

401
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,120
So it could be something specific.

402
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,912
So that's a grouping of all of these features.

403
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,776
So let's carry through an example.

404
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:38,368
If you're going to give your users an incentive,
what kind of an incentive could you give them.

405
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,440
AB: Well, I suppose you could
give them some free content.

406
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,704
AW: Anything else you
could give them as an incentive?

407
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:50,192
AB: To sign up?

408
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,808
AW: Yes, to get to here.

409
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:57,344
And these would be thinking
very specifically about Spanish adults.

410
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,440
AB: Yes, maybe we could do local deal.

411
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:13,744
In the Spanish market, we could give a
discount in local bookshops, something like that.

412
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:20,240
Maybe a discount on the print products would be
a good incentive for people to sign up to the website.

413
00:35:21,408 --> 00:35:26,272
AW: So I've got local
deals/discount, so that's another WHAT there.

414
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:29,008
AB: We could possible do some bundling as well.

415
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,024
If you sign up you get the book for free.

416
00:35:35,168 --> 00:35:37,808
AW: That's an incentive yes.

417
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:48,208
So free print products...
So this would be free digital content.

418
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,664
[They both talk at once]

419
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:58,800
So that's one carried through.

420
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,112
So we can see that we've got
this, this and this as some WHATS.

421
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:08,976
And we've got  an incentive,
which is our HOW, so our impact.

422
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:14,624
And we've got our user groups,
or actors... The WHO we were talking about.

423
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:20,800
These all map back to our goal,
which is 10,000 users signing up.

424
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:30,590
It's usually nice to put a bit more measurement
around that, like a time frame... It could help.

425
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,024
AB: Yes.

426
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:39,152
AW: The other thing I like about this
is that if you run these things as experiments.

427
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,696
The idea behind an impact map
is not to deliver everything on it.

428
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:48,944
It's to say, "Well we've got all these ideas,
we've got a few impacts that we want to happen".

429
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,888
We've got this broad concept called incentives.

430
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,480
And we've got a few ways
we can test if incentives works.

431
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,712
And not to do everything at once,
maybe do one first to see if it works.

432
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,528
Decide if we carry on or not with that.

433
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:11,408
This one here... Did local deals
and discounts work - if it did, great carry on.

434
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,008
AB: And they are measurable.

435
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,344
AW: Exactly, so I think this helps when
you have stakeholders that come in and say

436
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:25,104
"I want you to do this - make the icon
cornflower blue", or something like that.

437
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:32,720
I think it helps because you can say,
"Well, we need to test that, and we're testing this"

438
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:39,088
Or, you can say "how does it map
to this - making the icon cornflower blue"?

439
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,712
Maybe it doesn't.

440
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,864
This is a technique you should
be doing with the entire team,

441
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:54,416
and with stakeholders, making a
real joint effort, so everyones ideas are up there.

442
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,072
And then crucially, prioritizing these.

443
00:37:57,104 --> 00:37:59,760
So again, my favorite... Dot voting.

444
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,056
Maybe if we just use 2 of those
stars, even though I've given you a ton.

445
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:03,900
AB: OK.

446
00:38:04,656 --> 00:38:06,410
I'm going to do this one.

447
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,936
Is it these that you have to do?

448
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,136
AW: Yes.

449
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,920
And I don't really want to give
anything away really, but we'll do the free ones.

450
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,560
AW: Yes, so you might say
"these two are the most important".

451
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,200
Another thing to do is vote on the impacts as well,

452
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:27,296
because it might be that we
think that only a couple of these...

453
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:30,640
AB: And that forms the basis for your sprint.

454
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:37,936
AW: Yes, exactly, this can form part of the first
features that you plan to deliver with the team.

455
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:44,768
It can all go into your backlog... A list of
things that you would like to deliver in the future.

456
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,464
And things you would like to test. I keep
talking a lot about experimenting and testing,

457
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:55,936
and I think it's one of the most
important things when your working with agility.

458
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:04,000
Not to just assume you
know what's going to give you this.

459
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,096
So in a nutshell, that's impact mapping.

460
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:12,140
[New Chapter]

461
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,048
AW: So how was that for you Anna?

462
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,168
AB: That was great, really useful.
It's stuff that I can use straight away.

463
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:21,312
so I'm hoping that it will be fresh
in my mind for next week or the week after.

464
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,272
I especially like the impact mapping.

465
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:31,440
That's really good for getting things
broken down into measurable deliverables,

466
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,056
rather than just 'big project thinking'.
So that's really going to help.

467
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,088
AB: So thank you. AW: No problem at all.

468
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:46,816
Something I was going to mention...
I'm an Agile coach and it's like methodology agnostic.

469
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:53,376
And we didn't go into all the different
methodologies and techniques that make up Agile.

470
00:39:53,370 --> 00:40:00,144
We've got Scrum, there's XP, there's
so many different methodologies out there

471
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,968
that you can take as
starter patterns for how to work.

472
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,224
And there's other things like the basic
facilitation techniques that I showed you today

473
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:14,448
that can complement those sorts of patterns.

474
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:21,120
I think, depending on who you work with,
they will often tackle problems in a different way.

475
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:26,064
And even over time, an
Agile coach might learn new things

476
00:40:26,128 --> 00:40:28,432
and approach problems in different ways also.

477
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,696
And I think that's about being Agile as well.

478
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,144
AB: Being agile with you ability. [Laughter]

479
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,216
AW: And approaching your
Agile coaching with agility as well.

480
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:43,712
But I think we always come back to
those core principles of the Agile Manifesto.

481
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:49,536
And keep trying to work out whether
or not the things we are doing are valuable.

482
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:57,280
And try to cut out any waste... Anything
that might not be close to 'doing the thing'.

483
00:40:59,232 --> 00:41:00,832
Well, I think we will wrap up for today.

484
00:41:00,848 --> 00:41:02,080
AB: That was brilliant thank you.

485
00:41:02,144 --> 00:41:04,992
AW: Let me know how it goes.
