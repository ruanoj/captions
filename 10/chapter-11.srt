00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Chapter 11: Humanize the performance.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,260
SP: We have a thing which
I think fulfills the challenge.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,140
DN: Yeah.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,520
Part one is playing this thingy,
part two is playing the variations.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,490
And we have a user interface to
play and stop the music, and modify the tempo.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,340
That all works so the
challenge should be fulfilled.

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,230
DN: Yes sure.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,140
SP: The issue with this is, it sounds super robotic!

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,320
Normally when you play an instrument
and you are a human, you make some errors.

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:46,110
So I think we should make, every
note triggered slightly out of time.

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,380
So we'll add some randomness.

12
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:54,750
I would start with doing that so it sounds a
bit more natural. Because right now it's too perfect.

13
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:01,310
DN: Yes, I've seen sequencing programs where they
call it a 'humanize' function, it adds some jitter.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,880
SP: Yes, well we can just change the start time
slightly. Not by a whole beat, but more subtly.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,510
I will make it a little less
perfect until it sounds a bit better.

16
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,070
So for the last time, this
is too perfect [They listen].

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,000
DN: Yes.

18
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,590
SP: We can make it a bit more ‘amusing'.

19
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:30,470
We know when things are starting which is...

20
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:37,570
So this is the contextPlayTime. Instead of
using that we might get some randomness here.

21
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,870
Like, a little ‘indecisiveness' of the players.

22
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,370
So I will say getSomeRandom()

23
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,500
I'm going to make this function that
will return positive and negative values.

24
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,040
It could be that when you are playing,
sometimes you anticipate a bit.

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,030
Players are not perfect, they're not totally
in sync so it's OK to have some randomness here.

26
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,050
[Silence]

27
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,000
So we just make the function here.

28
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,230
So what do we return?

29
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,220
We can start with some randomness and
then adjust depending on what we see.

30
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,030
0.5 second is a lot, but so we can see the difference.

31
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,560
[Silence]

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,790
You can call the random() function but
this returns [a value] between 0.0 and 1.0.

33
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,270
So if I multiply that with 0.5 it's going to be just 0.0 to 0.5.

34
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,880
So that means it's always going to be a bit later.

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,970
I want some to be a bit earlier.

36
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:55,370
So if I have `0.5 - Math.random()` this
is going to be in -0.5 to 0.5 ... I think.

37
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,330
[Sole thinks]

38
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,860
Or, one minus this might be from zero to...

39
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,790
So this can be negative or positive...
I don't know now. [laughter]

40
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,530
DN: Wouldn't that mean the
maximum value would be zero?

41
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,600
SP: Yes. So I want this thing.

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,390
So if it's zero it's 0.5? Or maybe...
OK, I'm just going to leave it like that. Whatever.

43
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,330
DN: Let's see what happens.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,010
SP: So this needs a semi colon.

45
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,480
Now it should be a bit more erratic.

46
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,080
Oh no, why not.

47
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,070
What am I returning?

48
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,060
[Silence]

49
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:51,380
So if it's negative? WHAT?
This doesn't make any sense. Why?

50
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,160
I'm going to debug this thingy.

51
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,970
What is when, which is fine.

52
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,960
[Silence]

53
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,800
I guess it's because I've set the
debugger which introduces some delay,

54
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,320
so I'm not getting a negative time here.

55
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,270
DN: Interesting yes.

56
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,350
SP: So I'm going to remove the breakpoint thingy.

57
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,820
[They listen]

58
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:29,080
It's really messy. Because
they are really bad players!

59
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,630
DN: I think the variation there
is longer than a beat isn't it?

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,290
SP: Yeah exactly.

61
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,370
I hate this! I always want to have a
page with all of the one-liners I can check

62
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,782
and make sure that they're OK.

63
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:44,960
This is going to go from 1 to 0,
but that's not what I want.

64
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,690
So if I multiply this...

65
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,390
This is me going off on a long-winded... So 2 minus...

66
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,870
What am I doing? Argh!

67
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:09,200
1...This is easier: 1-0=1 1-1=0

68
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:21,650
I think if it's: 0.5 - 1 = -0.5,

69
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:30,150
OK, this is the one I want. And if I
multiply that by 2 I get the right thing.

70
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,640
What I wanted actually to write from
the beginning, but I didn't know how was...

71
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,500
I knew that there was a one-liner, without the whole story.

72
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,720
DN: So that will give you a value between -1.0 and +1.0?

73
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,300
SP: Yeah! This is going to return from minus 1 to 1.

74
00:05:52,300 --> 00:06:00,780
I'm going to multiply that by
something else... 0.1 of a second.

75
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,620
Maybe we should base this on the beat.

76
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,510
This is because I'm working to small values.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,710
This is still very terrible.

78
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:25,690
Yes if the current time is
minus we should win more probably.

79
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,650
[Sole thinks]

80
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:43,040
I'm going to make it always be slower.

81
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,290
[They listen]

82
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,030
SP: It's slightly better.

83
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,190
DN: A little bit sloppy.

84
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,770
SP: Yes, but that's what you want.

85
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,040
[They listen]

86
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,640
This is too much, let's make it slower.

87
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,650
It's not so mechanical.

88
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,520
Maybe we can make it more crappy.

89
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,930
It's good to adjust it and see
when does it stop sounding terrible.

90
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,070
This is too much.

91
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,970
DN: It is yeah.

92
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,440
SP: This is too much I think... [They listen]

93
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,660
I will leave it at 2.

94
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,950
[They listen]

95
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,630
Yes, I think this is good.

96
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,110
If I make it 0 there is no change at all.

97
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,910
It sound fully on the beat.

98
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,530
This is very subtle.

99
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,590
DN: Sure, I think you left it
at 0.2 rather than 0.02 there.

100
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,270
SP: Inaud

101
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:19,700
[They listen]

102
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,110
I think this is too much inaud this.

103
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,170
OK stop.

104
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,530
[Silence]

105
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,720
Variation! Sometimes you
need to explain what you did.

106
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,670
I was going to just say "make it
more humane", but what does that mean?
