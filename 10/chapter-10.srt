Chapter 10: Adding a tempo control.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:08,640
Now I need to add the
listener for the for the bpm event.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,990
And this one is slightly different because
I need to read the data from the event.

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:22,380
It's not just like an action I need
to read the data from the event.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:29,770
It's using custom events, I don't know who designed
this thing but you can't just put properties.

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,860
You have to use details. I guess
it's so you don't create properties.

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:45,050
With the object inaud future
properties in the spec or the events in general.

8
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,250
So you can only access them through the detail.

9
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:54,370
In this case the value that
you get is value [Laughter].

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:00,100
So if you have a bpm event
this is a new value you will get.

11
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,870
I will log it and you can see.

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,150
The new values are inaud.

13
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,420
[They listen]

14
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,320
SP: I can change that.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,660
There's lot of changes so OK. Inaud

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,330
You just need to change the new bpm.

17
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,380
The score is being changed all the time.

18
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,490
The events are calculated based on the current
bpm every time the schedule function is run.

19
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,610
It will take the value that we send it,
and we can change that on the fly.

20
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,900
The only issue with this is
that this might be sent as a string?

21
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,550
Because it's coerced. I always
make sure to multiply by one.

22
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,210
DN: Ah right.

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,680
SP: Especially if you try to add things because it
might end up concatenating strings with numbers.

24
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,760
So in case of that, I just multiply the thingy.

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,830
And we have a global variable somewhere here.
So we can just say the bpm is this new value.

26
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,560
And hopefully that should change.

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,340
[They listen]

28
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:19,290
[The music starts slowly and gets faster]

29
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,430
SP: So now it's going really fast.

30
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,220
DN: How fast will it go.

31
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,930
SP: I think it's limited to 300.

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,740
Because, I do some happy hardcore
things. I think It's from 300 to 1.

33
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,800
DN: Yes.

34
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,090
This is really slow, it's one beat per minute.

35
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,700
I guess we can also add this thing.
I never remember what I changed.

36
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:54,400
In a more complex project I would use source tree so
I can see the whole thing but for this it's fine to use....

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,420
[Silence]

38
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,880
I think this meets the challenge...

39
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,040
Because you can play and stop the music
and have a way of modifying the tempo.
