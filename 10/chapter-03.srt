00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chapter 3: Adding a limiter.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,540
This is OK, but sometimes you want
to make sure things don't get too noisy

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,570
because maybe this sample is super
super saturated. You don't want it to be deafening.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,000
So it's a good idea to insert
a limiter, in the meantime.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,670
So instead of connecting the sample
to the destination, you connect it to the limiter.

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,360
So you don't maximize all the sounds.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,350
DN: So you don't blow up your speakers.
SP: Exactly!

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:43,380
So I will create this thing up
here... Very imaginative name!

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:51,310
And I will create another node
which I think is called 'compressor'...

10
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,730
DynamicsCompressor.

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,520
So instead of connecting to the
destination, I will connect to the limiter.

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,960
And then I  will connect the limiter to
the destination.  So we create this whole chain.

13
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,920
And this is always connected,
so we don't need to do this all the time.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,630
So I will connect this into the limiter.

15
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,990
and it should still play. [We hear a clap]

16
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,080
DN: OK.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,015
It's not doing the formal...

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,010
See this is base here.

19
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,810
DN: So we're seeing the graph?

20
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:35,430
SP: Yes, but we don't see the BufferStore
because it's just died and it's been deleted.

21
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,550
DN: I see.

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,810
SP: You see now everything has gone
because we're not using it anymore.

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,090
DN: The garbage collector has kicked in.
SP: The GC is doing his thing! [laughter]

24
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,270
So you saw that very briefly.

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,640
DN: For a fraction of a second!

26
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,120
SP: When we have more things running.
We will see more things showing up.

27
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,500
and it's interesting to make sure that
things don't stay.

28
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,720
Because that's a memory leak.

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,735
So when you don't disconnect things,
or when things are being connected for too long

30
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:06,260
this will grow a lot and you think Hmm...
Maybe we should check that everything's correct.

31
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,655
So it's good to keep an eye on this.

32
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:13,480
If things are sounding correctly. We want to make
sure things are really disposed of quickly.

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,450
DN: Yes.

34
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,750
SP: So we've got this thing but it's just
like a clap and we want to play the sequence.

35
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:28,640
SP: So I would create a repo here and then just init.

36
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:39,910
And obviously, everything's new. So I'll just add
clap, index, main, and I'll commit that as ‘Hello world'.

37
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,210
So there we go.

38
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,680
I will have things that are sounding but we
want to follow the sequence that you explained.

39
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,820
Also before I continue I want to remove this
from here because it's going to be blocking the body.

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,680
and if its huge, the people will be saying
what's going on here? I don't see anything.

41
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:09,580
So it's best to move it here and set it as
defer. So at least you get to see "Clapping music".

42
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,920
And I get something. Something's been
rendered before...

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,120
DN: Ahh... Right.

44
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,480
SP: So it will have something like
loading, or this is an example of whatever.

45
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,290
For now we can just keep it like this.

46
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:39,040
[Sole types]

47
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,110
SP: At some point you might add more
libraries and it ends up growing.

48
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,330
Depending on the connection speed it can
take a long time of blocking and nothing happening

49
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:53,900
and you get these blank pages happening people
loose interest, and you don't want that. [Laughter]

50
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,520
SP: You want people to stay, and wait for
your magic.
