00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,697
Chapter 13: Panning each player left or right.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,731
SP: I did commit this thing.

3
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:10,651
And instead of reverting this thing, I'm going to
reuse this structure I created for the gains.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,285
And instead of changing the volume,

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:19,725
I'm going to make sure that each panning node is on a
different side so each player is on a different side.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,950
The playBuffer() function had the gainIndex and the gainValue.

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,411
I don't need the gainValue because
the panning is going to be set.

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,337
So I'm going to remove that.

9
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:41,897
So one of the notes will be on
the left or the right, or whatever it is.

10
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:45,211
We don't need this.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,251
Instead of gain it should be panNode.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,234
This I don't need.

13
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:11,005
The structure is pretty much the same.

14
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:14,400
I could maybe replace all.

15
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:25,680
DN: Is there still a gainNodes somewhere?

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,257
SP: Yes, some gains somewhere
but we know where they are.

17
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:37,280
This is going to play in the pan zero.

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,114
We don't care about the
values now because they are inaud.

19
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,868
This is a terrible function call
because it's clapSamples1,

20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,790
plus some time and one number,
but you don't know what it is.

21
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,685
It's not the best practice but
you could elaborate on that later.

22
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,102
I don't like this, "magic
numbers" thing it's pretty terrible.

23
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,382
OK so we need to create
panNodes instead of gainNodes.

24
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,057
I think it's Panner actually.

25
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,177
Let me make sure.

26
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:26,800
There is also a StereoPannerNode, which is
the one we want because it's easier to set up.

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,725
So this StereoPannerNode just
goes left and right with the pan thingy.

28
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:37,520
Whereas the other one is 3D, and you
need to set up direction and the listener

29
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:42,011
and also specify the listener. So
this one is easier - just left and right.

30
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:52,205
So I want to create the StereoPanner... And nodes.

31
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,600
This is a habit with me.

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,354
DN: g... p...

33
00:02:56,788 --> 00:03:02,530
SP: So I connect this thing here.
I also need to specify it's pan.

34
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,411
This is terrible.

35
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,382
So p pan value.

36
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:12,057
DN: Is this going to be something  between -1 and +1?

37
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:18,068
SP: Yes, -1 is full left, and plus one [full right]...
So how do I do inaud function of this.

38
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm going to be super lazy
because we are running out of time.

39
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:47,177
I'm going to say v: allow here
if j is zero minus one plus one.

40
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,211
Because we are just going to write from zero to one.

41
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,508
Maybe we don't want it to be so specialized,

42
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:57,565
because this is extreme left and
extreme right, but we will see.

43
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,365
Sometimes you don't want
to do it so saturated because,

44
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:04,240
if you play it in places that have
proper speakers, some people won't listen to it

45
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,080
because they are in the wrong place.
But I think for us this should be OK.

46
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,468
So hopefully this should still work.

47
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,354
[They listen]

48
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,137
Yes, stereo.

49
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,142
DN: Can you tell?

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,011
SP: I can.

51
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:28,754
DN: Yes I can hear it now. From where
I'm sitting I'm just getting a wall of sound.

52
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:34,057
SP: Like the inaud from before but...

53
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:40,354
I'm trying to click on this to
stop it but it's hard to capture.

54
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:50,537
Anyway in theory you can see
where the property is, if you could stop it.

55
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,565
Now you can see the pan here.
